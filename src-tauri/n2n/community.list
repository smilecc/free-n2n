# List of allowed communities
# ---------------------------
#
#      these could either be fixed-name communities such as the following lines ...
#
mynetwork
netleo
#
#      ... or regular expressions that a community name must fully match
#      such as ntop[0-1][0-9] for communities from "ntop00" through "ntop19"
# 
ntop[0-1][0-9]
#
#   *  Note that fixed-name communities may not contain one of the following characters
#      . * + ? [ ] \
#      as otherwise, they are interpreted as regular expression
#
#   *  Only fixed-name communities are supported for header encryption (-H)
#
#   *  Regular expression support the following placeholders
#      '.'        Dot, matches any character
#      '*'        Asterisk, match zero or more (greedy)
#      '+'        Plus, match one or more (greedy)
#      '?'        Question, match zero or one (non-greedy)
#      '[abc]'    Character class, match if one of {'a', 'b', 'c'}
#      '[^abc]'   Inverted class, match if NOT one of {'a', 'b', 'c'}  (feature is currently broken)
#      '[a-zA-Z]' Character ranges, the character set of the ranges { a-z | A-Z }
#      '\s'       Whitespace, \t \f \r \n \v and spaces
#      '\S'       Non-whitespace
#      '\w'       Alphanumeric, [a-zA-Z0-9_]
#      '\W'       Non-alphanumeric
#      '\d'       Digits, [0-9]
#      '\D'       Non-digits
#
#      fixed-name communities can optionally be followed by a network using the 
#      network/bitlen syntax such as the following line
#
home 192.168.168.0/24
#
#      the supernode draws ip addresses to assign to the edges (if they omit the `-a`
#      parameter) from this network. note that the network is delimited by [SPACE] so
#      community names cannot contain [SPACE] either.
#   
#      if no network is provided here, the supernode assigns some other network to each
#      community. networks are taken from the default range 10.128.0.0 - 10.255.255.0/24
#      as long as no other network range is provided through the supernode's command line
#      option `-d`. those sub-networks are distinct so several edges with different
#      communities can be used at the same computer (being served ip addresses from the
#      same supernode). also, the sub-networks described in this file are avoided.
#
#      however, all networks assigned in this file are not mutually checked for colliding 
#      ranges so different communities can use same or overlapping sub-networks. that does
#      not impose a problem if the communities do not share edge nodes.
#
#      there seems to be no sense in pre-assigning sub-networks to communities whose
#      names are defined by regular expressions. those will be assigned distinct
#      sub-networks from the default range or the `-d` range.
#
#      if `-a` is used with the edge, the edge uses the ip address specified with the
#      `-a xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx` option. also, the enhanced syntax `-r -a dhcp:0.0.0.0` is
#      still available to have more professional needs served by a full dhcp server.
